Of course. The provided Wolfram Language expression defines a notebook cell containing a typeset mathematical formula.

### Code Breakdown

Let's break down the expression from the inside out:

1.  **The Mathematical Expression:**
    `x + Cosh[x + y] Exp[x + x] + Sinh[x + x] + O[x + x^y]/Sqrt[x + y]`

    *   `x + x`: The Wolfram Language automatically simplifies this to `2x`.
    *   `Exp[2x]`: This is the exponential function, e^(2x).
    *   `Cosh[x + y]`: The hyperbolic cosine of `(x + y)`.
    *   `Sinh[2x]`: The hyperbolic sine of `(2x)`.
    *   `Sqrt[x + y]`: The square root of `(x + y)`.
    *   `O[x + x^y]`: This is the "Big-O" notation. It represents omitted terms in a series expansion that are of the order of `x + x^y` or higher. This term typically arises from using the `Series` function.

2.  **`ToBoxes[...]`:**
    This function takes the simplified mathematical expression and converts it into a "box" representation, which is the low-level structure Wolfram Language uses for typesetting formulas in 2D, just as you would see them in a textbook.

3.  **`Cell[BoxData[...]]`:**
    This is the final wrapper. It creates a complete notebook cell whose content (`BoxData`) is the typeset formula generated by `ToBoxes`.

### Simplified Expression

Before typesetting, the Wolfram Language simplifies the core expression to:

```wolfram
x + E^(2*x)*Cosh[x + y] + Sinh[2*x] + O[x + x^y]/Sqrt[x + y]
```
*(Note: `Exp[arg]` is displayed as `E^arg` in StandardForm/InputForm).*

### Formatted Output

If you were to execute this `Cell` expression in a Wolfram Notebook, it would render the following beautifully formatted mathematical expression:

$$x + e^{2x} \cosh(x+y) + \sinh(2x) + \frac{O(x+x^y)}{\sqrt{x+y}}$$
