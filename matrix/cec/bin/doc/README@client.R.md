After running these two lines of R code, the variable `S2` will also contain the value `512`.

### Explanation:

1.  `S1 <- 512`
    This line assigns the single numeric value `512` to the variable `S1`. In R, this is treated as a vector of length one.

2.  `S2 <- cummax(S1)`
    The `cummax()` function stands for **cumulative maximum**. It processes a vector from the first element to the last, and for each position, it returns the highest value encountered *up to that point*.

Let's see how it works with a more complex example:

```R
x <- c(3, 5, 2, 8, 7)
cummax(x)
# [1] 3 5 5 8 8 
```
*   The first value is `3`.
*   The max of `(3, 5)` is `5`.
*   The max of `(3, 5, 2)` is still `5`.
*   The max of `(3, 5, 2, 8)` is `8`.
*   The max of `(3, 5, 2, 8, 7)` is still `8`.

---

**Applying this to your code:**

*   `S1` is a vector with only one element: `512`.
*   The cumulative maximum of a single-element vector is just the element itself.
*   Therefore, `cummax(512)` evaluates to `512`.
*   This value is then assigned to `S2`.

**In summary:**

```R
# Your code:
S1 <- 512
S2 <- cummax(S1)

# The result:
print(S2)
# [1] 512
```
